The power to know true information

In the digital universe, there exists a small but powerful cybersecurity company named ‚ÄúN8-X‚Äù, inspired by Neptune. The last planet of the Solar System. Small, agile, and mysterious, N8-X does not rely on certifications or formal seals, yet its strength and reach are undeniable, as its resources and knowledge shine like a rain of diamonds.

For those who understand its character, it is clear that N8-X orbits the greatest sources of power and learning, gathering valuable insights from the experiences of larger planets. Seen from a different perspective, it is actually first for those who know how to look beyond the conventional, guided by strategy and precisely planned objectives (X).

Within its coded walls, the team explores the most elusive threats. From 0 days & secret RCE vulnerabilities to sophisticated phishing campaigns. Motto is simple and powerful: We acknowledge only what we can describe through action, not by seal.
